# IslamicDate

IslamicDate implements a tabluar Islamic Calendar.

The actual Islamic Calendar relies on human observations of the moon.
This implementation uses Microsoft's Kuwaiti algorithm to approximate
the date in the Islamic Calendar system. The date used by this software
will differ from the actual date by no more than three days.
